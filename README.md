# Faster Dynamically Instrumented Programs

_A look at floating-point emulation in ARM Linux_

## Overview

This is the final submission of my third-year university project at King's College London.

### Abstract

This project borrows existing dynamic program instrumentation techniques to propose a faster method of emulating floating-point instructions on Unix-like operating systems than what is provided by the kernel. The proposed method replaces floating-point instructions with branches that indirectly lead to emulation code resident in the same process’ memory. This prevents some execution flow switching into kernel code to run the kernel’s floating-point instruction emulator which theoretically reduces overhead for every instruction emulated.

## Introduction

This tool is designed to be built and run on Armel Debian on an ARMv7(-a) CPU. It requires the 'librunt' and 'keystone' git repositories as well as other dependencies.

## Installation

To set up the project, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mbeardwell/arm-fp-emu.git
cd arm-fp-emu
```

## Build instructions

1. Install dependencies

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
bash install-dependencies.sh
```

_Note: The script automates installation but does not guarantee robustness or safety._

2. Build

```bash
make librunt
make keystone
make arm-fp-emu
make build-tests
```

This can take hours which is why each must be made separately. If something goes wrong building one, less progress is lost restarting at the point of failure.
    
## Testing

To run tests:

```bash
make test
```

This will run something of the form

```bash
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=[...]/lib LD_PRELOAD=./build/arm-fp-emu.so ./tests/build/vadd10 10
```

LD_LIBRARY_PATH is necessary for how I'm using Keystone, but Keystone could technically be used in a way that removes the need to use this environment variable.

## Video Walkthrough

This video provides a step-by-step demonstration of how my floating-point emulation program works using the GNU Debugger (GDB). It walks through a test binary, showing how floating-point instructions are replaced with branches to trampoline code that redirects execution to an emulation routine.

### What’s Covered in the Video?

* Debugging the program using GDB.
* How floating-point instructions are replaced with branch instructions.
* The role of trampoline code in redirecting execution.
* How the emulation routine processes floating-point operations.
* Why this method is eventually faster than kernel-based instruction emulation.
